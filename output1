The betweenness array is (bigger is better):
  1.)Node   1 is in 528
  2.)Node   3 is in 334
  3.)Node  33 is in 292
  4.)Node  34 is in 126
  5.)Node  32 is in  72
  6.)Node   6 is in  60
  7.)Node  28 is in  48
  8.)Node   9 is in  44
  9.)Node  24 is in  30
 10.)Node   2 is in  30
The closeness array is (total distance)(smaller is better):
  1.)Node   1 is in  58
  2.)Node   3 is in  59
  3.)Node  34 is in  61
  4.)Node  32 is in  61
  5.)Node  33 is in  64
  6.)Node   9 is in  64
  7.)Node  14 is in  65
  8.)Node  20 is in  67
  9.)Node   2 is in  68
 10.)Node   4 is in  71
