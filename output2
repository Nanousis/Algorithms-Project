Calculating Floyd-Warshall. O(n^3) may take a few minutes
memory: current progress = 0 / 4942
memory: current progress = 1000 / 4942
memory: current progress = 2000 / 4942
memory: current progress = 3000 / 4942
memory: current progress = 4000 / 4942
The betweenness array is (bigger is better):
  1.)Node 651 is in 6920928
